- add a "reset" button (on Windows, to reload the config after you have changed it without going to the Services -> Orthanc -> Restart)
- show ohif-vr and ohif-tmtv buttons only when relevant (analyse the content of the study)

- predefined filters in config file to display below Studies:
  - "Today": {"StudyDate": "$today"}
  - "CT Last month": {"ModalitiesInStudy": "CT", "StudyDate": "$oneMonthAgo-"}
    predefined keywords: $today, $yesterday, $oneWeekAgo, $oneMonthAgo, $oneYearAgo

UI improvements:
- Admin theme including responsive tables (including multiline): https://github.com/lekoala/admini
- when opening the series view I would prefer to see an image and itâ€™s labels over a list of instance numbers and paired SOPInstanceUIDs:
  https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/beginner-questions-from-horos-user/5322

- modification:
  - configuration to hide DICOM UID options and select the right one directly for a given setup.
  - add a Series Description renamer (one dialog to edit SeriesNumber + SeriesDescription of a study)

- settings:
  - show the list of /tools/accepted-transfer-syntaxes
  - show the list of /tools/accepted-sop-classes (in 1.12.6)

- Add a PDF/Image dicomization (https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/orthanc-explorer-2-dicomization-feature-suggestion/6061/4).
  Not to attach a new series to an existing study but to create a new study.


- show attachments

- support neuro plugin (download nifti)

- TagsTree: allow click on "null" tags to open /instances/../content/group,element in new window

- show job details (need improvement in Orthanc API itself)
- include an "all jobs" panel and not only our jobs (https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/oe2-inclusion-of-jobs-panel-in-explorer-2/3708)

- list last studies received (through DICOM or upload)

- UI customization:
 - configure other viewers url (ex: radiant://?n=pstv&v=0020000D&v=%22StudyInstanceUID%22 or osirix or horos ...)
   - Radiant: sample: https://github.com/boskar/orthanc-radiant/blob/main/radiant.py

- orthanc-share should generate QR code with publication links

- Q&R on multiple modalities at a same time (select the modalities you want to Q&R and display the modality in the study list)
  (same with Q&R for dicom-web and peers)

- in local study list, display the number of studies that are present on a remote modality for this patient (e.g: a cold archive)
  - Add a button to fetch all these data (todo: find a way to delete them after a while ?)
  - same with dicom-web and peers ?


Configuration management (ideas + implementation notes):
-------------------------------

- allow Orthanc to store anything in Global Properties.  Maybe not through the API but only through the SDK.
  Or, only for an "admin" user ?

- Edit configuration through the oe2 UI:
  - Some immutable configuration in a config file:
    - DB + storage
    - Admin user !
    - HttpPort
  - Check if we could store a config in Global Properties (probably too early in the Orthanc init process).  We would merge the file config with the config in DB
  - Otherwise, store the config in a file and restart Orthanc 
    -> in Windows Service: how to tell Orthanc to use another config file ?
    -> would be nice to have a SDK route to implement /tools/reboot with a given config file
  - Could be a combination of 2:
    - start Orthanc with config from file
    - plugin reads the config in DB, generates a tmp config file -> /tools/reboot with this file
    - that's a bit "shaky" since each cold start is made of 2 starts

Ideas bag:
*********

- allow users to choose the columns in the interface (store in browser LocalStorage ?)
- browse orthanc peer (probably need to extend the Orthanc API to avoid CORS issues)
- show statistics/event logs: e.g: would be nice to see how many instances
  have been received recently (from where)
- add a button to export a whole series to jpeg (Chamrousse): we could reuse [this python code](https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/book/plugins/python.html#generating-a-mosaic-for-a-dicom-series) and trigger it from a [custom button](https://github.com/orthanc-server/orthanc-explorer-2/issues/18) (once we have implemented them !!!)
- add a text editor to associate a radiology report or note with a study, storing it as an attachment (cf. https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/oe2-inclusion-of-reporting-note/)
